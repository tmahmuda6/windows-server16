2. Key Tools for Server Management
There are several tools available for administrators to manage Windows Server 2016. These tools enhance the overall management experience and simplify complex tasks.
2.1. Server Manager
Server Manager is a primary tool used by system administrators for the management of Windows Server. It provides a central dashboard for monitoring server health, configuring roles, and managing remote servers.
Key Features:
Dashboard with real-time server performance.
Installation and management of server roles.
Integration with Remote Desktop Services for easier server management.
2.2. PowerShell
PowerShell 5.1, bundled with Windows Server 2016, is a task automation framework. It allows administrators to automate repetitive tasks and manage the server environment using command-line scripts.
Key Features:
Remote Management: Allows remote administration of servers without requiring a local login.
Modules: Extends functionality through modules like Hyper-V and Active Directory.
Scripting: Custom scripts can be written to automate complex processes.
2.3. Windows Admin Center
Windows Admin Center is a modern, web-based management interface that allows administrators to manage their entire IT infrastructure from a single platform. This tool integrates with both Windows Server and Hyper-V environments, making it versatile and user-friendly.
 
3. Managing Server Roles and Features
Windows Server 2016 offers a variety of server roles and features that can be easily installed and managed using the tools above. Some of the most important roles include:
3.1. Active Directory Domain Services (AD DS)
AD DS is one of the most essential roles in any Windows Server environment. It allows administrators to manage the identities and permissions of users and computers across the network.
Key Features:
Group Policy Management: Centralized management of user and computer policies.
Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA): Enhances security by requiring more than one form of identification.
3.2. Web Server (IIS)
The Internet Information Services (IIS) role allows administrators to manage websites, web applications, and FTP services.
Feature	Description
App Pool Management	Ensures web applications run smoothly by isolating them in different pools.
SSL Configuration	Provides support for secure communication via HTTPS.
Logging	Tracks user activity and provides logs for troubleshooting.
3.3. DHCP and DNS
Dynamic Host Configuration Protocol (DHCP) and Domain Name System (DNS) are integral roles for assigning IP addresses and translating domain names into IP addresses.
DHCP: Automatically assigns IP addresses to devices on the network.
DNS: Resolves domain names to IP addresses, helping users and applications access network resources by name.
 
4. Security Enhancements
Security is always a top priority in server management. Windows Server 2016 introduces several security features that protect against modern threats.
4.1. Shielded Virtual Machines
Shielded VMs prevent unauthorized access to virtualized environments. Using BitLocker, Windows Server 2016 ensures that data stored in the VM is encrypted, preventing data theft or manipulation.
4.2. Windows Defender Antivirus
Windows Defender Antivirus is now built directly into Windows Server 2016. It provides real-time protection against malware and other threats without the need for additional antivirus software.
4.3. Just Enough Administration (JEA)
JEA is a security technology that limits the administrative privileges granted to users. It allows administrators to configure restricted administrative environments, reducing the risk of malicious actions.
 
5. Virtualization with Hyper-V
Hyper-V in Windows Server 2016 has several enhancements that improve performance and management. Virtualization allows businesses to run multiple virtual machines (VMs) on a single physical server.
Enhancement	Description
Storage Quality of Service	Enables administrators to set performance thresholds for virtual disks.
Nested Virtualization	Run Hyper-V inside a virtual machine, useful for testing and development.
Virtual Switch Improvements	Improved virtual network management for better security and scalability.
 
6. Storage Solutions
Windows Server 2016 offers advanced storage solutions like Storage Spaces Direct and Storage Replica, which improve data redundancy and availability.
6.1. Storage Spaces Direct
This feature allows administrators to pool together local storage on servers to create a highly available and scalable storage solution.
Key Benefits:
Fault Tolerance: Built-in redundancy ensures data is not lost even in case of hardware failure.
Cost-Effective: No need for expensive storage hardware solutions.
6.2. Storage Replica
Storage Replica provides synchronous replication for disaster recovery. It ensures that data is continuously replicated between two servers, keeping both sites in sync.
 
7. Remote Desktop Services (RDS)
Remote Desktop Services allows users to access Windows Server remotely. RDS 2016 includes several enhancements over previous versions:
Remote Desktop Session Host (RDSH): Hosts Windows-based programs or desktops.
Virtual Desktop Infrastructure (VDI): Allows each user to have a personalized virtual desktop.
RemoteFX: Optimizes the user experience, especially for graphics-heavy applications.
